# CodeAlpha_Fibonacci_Generator
# Fibonacci Generator Project

## Project Description:

This project generates the Fibonacci sequence using two different approaches:
1. Recursive Approach: Uses a recursive function to generate the Fibonacci series.
2. Iterative Approach: Uses a loop to generate the series efficiently.
The program prompts the user to enter the number of terms, then prints the Fibonacci sequence using both methods.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save the fibonacci.py file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using:
        - python fibonacci.py
5. Enter the number of terms when prompted.
6. The program will output the Fibonacci series using both recursive and iterative methods.

## Example Output

Enter the number of terms for Fibonacci series: 10
Recursive Fibonacci: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
Iterative Fibonacci: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

## Features

- Recursive and iterative Fibonacci sequence generation.
- Handles invalid input cases (negative numbers).
- Simple and efficient implementation.
